Heap uses arrays....

*not allowed to use any pointers*

Binary heap achieves this with no pointers... (basically an array)

A binary heap with k keys are stored in indices 1 to k *DOES NOT use index 0*
(normal array 0 -> (k-1) )

Such an array A[1 : k]
called a min-heap if
A[i] <= A[2 * i]

A[i] <= A[(2*i) + 1]
